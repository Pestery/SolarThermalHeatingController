The file 'ControllerTest.cbp' is a CodeBlocks project file.
CodeBlocks is my (Matt) preferred editor for C++ code.

CodeBlocks should NOT be required!

The only file which needs to be compiled is 'main.cpp'.
The hope is that most editors should be able to compile a single standalone file without too much trouble.
If not, then using command-line might be an option as well.

The compiled executable will run through the tests and then exit immediately.
Run the executable with an editor, or a terminal/command-line window to make the results viewable.

If project files or similar are added for other editors, then
make sure to add as much as possible to the '.gitignore' file.
