To program ESP8266 chip using PC               | off | off | off | off | ON  | ON  | ON  | off |
To communicate between Arduino and PC          | off | off | ON  | ON  | off | off | off | off |
To communicate between ESP8266 and PC          | off | off | off | off | ON  | ON  | off | off |

To comminucate between Arduino, ESP8266 and PC | ON  | ON  | ON  | ON  | off | off | off | off |

When communicating between Arduino, ESP8266 and PC:
 - The ESP8266 should be set to use serial3 using the dip switch (set to RXD3-TXD3 instead of RXD0-TXD0)
 - The Arduino should be coded to use Serial to communicate with the PC
 - The Arduino should be coded to use Serial3 to communicate with the ESP8266
